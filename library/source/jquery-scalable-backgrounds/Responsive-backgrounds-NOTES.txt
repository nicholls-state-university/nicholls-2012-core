Gotta say, I’m with some of the other commenters here: background-size seems the much better way to go.
Though of course, the JavaScript solution brings the feature to older browsers.
I’d recommend serving background-size in your normal CSS to all browsers, then 
use Modernizr to detect “.no-backgrondsize”, then offer this ‘polyfill’ method to those less capable browsers.

html { 
	background: url(images/bg.jpg) no-repeat center center fixed; 
	-webkit-background-size: cover;
	-moz-background-size: cover;
	-o-background-size: cover;
	background-size: cover;
}
